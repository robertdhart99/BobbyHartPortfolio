for localhost deployment: 

cd into correct file path

npm install --force or --legacy-peer-deps
	* uses react-reveal which causes problems with other modern dependencies. 

npm start 

can be found on localhost:8000

was originally made with an older Gatsby template running on node 13.14.0 but many of the dependencies had depreciated so I moved the content over to a modern base Gatsby template with more current dependencies. 

I moved between node versions with nvm on a Windows environment.
